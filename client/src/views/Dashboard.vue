      <p>The Transactions and Savings pages contain some sample data. The data has been randomized
        so it might not all make sense.</p>
      <p>Statistics page generates charts out of the saved data. Keep in mind that the charts are
        old components from a earlier version of this app and look a bit out of place.</p>
